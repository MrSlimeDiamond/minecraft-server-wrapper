# Minecraft Server Wrapper
> Under heavy development!

A wrapper for Minecraft: Java edition multiplayer servers

Tested only on Vanilla, but Bukkit/Sponge/Canary/...etc will likely work with minimal modification.

Currently fires events and that's about it lol

## Usage
### Requirements
* Rust
### Setting up
> This might change
1. Clone this repository into your Minecraft servers root directory (i.e: /home/minecraft/minecraft_server)
2. Use `cargo run` to run the `minecraft_server.jar` file under the wrapper.
